# Acquiring images (Module 3)

This directory contains a Python notebook designed to be a standalone tutorial demonstrating how you can acquire images from the [iDigBio portal](https://www.idigbio.org/portal/search) based on your own research scope. For the remainder of the lessons in today's workshop we will be using a standard set of images provided by the workshop instructors. This module will show you how that set of images was originally acquired, and provide an opportunity for you to test out downloading images yourself.

Our goals are for you to be able to:
1. Define search parameters
1. Retrieve specimen media records that meet those parameters
1. Download media associated with those specimen records
1. Review media and conduct quality control

This module contains two versions of the same notebook:

* A "completed" version where all code has been executed so that you can see the results:

* A "ready to run" version that you can execute the code in for yourself, or copy and edit as you wish:

As a complement to the content covered in this workshop, here is the same workflow executed in R instead of Python, [How to download media based on specimen record search, using R and iDigBio](https://biodiversity-specimen-data.github.io/specimen-data-use-case/use-case/download-media-from-specimens.html).
